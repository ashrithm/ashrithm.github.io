Hello World! This is my first post on the blog. If you know me at all, you know I have been planning on starting this blog for what seems like an eternity at this point. I'm talking about a solid 10+ years of deliberation.

But as the great Forrest Gump once said, "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."

## What's this blog about?

I have a tendency of wanting to do anything and everything that interests me, from aerospace engineering, to building random projects like a USB-powered heated chair seat cushion, to watching cat videos. So this blog will be a collection of my thoughts, ideas, and projects that I find interesting.

## What's next?

There's so much that I want to write about, but I'll try to keep it focused (or at least try). One project I'm excited about is improving the blog itself. Adding features, experimenting with different designs, and maybe even making it a bit more interactive. Basically anything to procrastinate on the actual writing part.

So that's the "Hello World" post! Pretty chill, I know. But hey, it's a start. And as they say, the first step is always the hardest.

Until next time! Cheers 👋🏽
